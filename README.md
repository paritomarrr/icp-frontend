# ICP Model Frontend (Workflows.io)

## Overview

This project is the frontend for the ICP Model (Workflows.io), a modern onboarding and GTM data collection tool. The app features a multi-step onboarding wizard that collects detailed information about a business, its products, segments, personas, and outbound experience. The new design is focused on clarity, flexibility, and actionable dataâ€”without any AI enrichment except for field-level suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-step onboarding wizard**: Each major section (Admin, Product Understanding, Offer & Sales, Social Proof, Target Segments, Previous Outbound Experience) is a separate step.
- **Dynamic segment/persona entry**: Add multiple segments and personas as needed.
- **Field-level AI suggestions**: Get helpful suggestions for each field, but no auto-enrichment or extra AI data is stored.
- **Modern, clean UI**: Designed for clarity and ease of use.
- **Dedicated pages for Products, Segments, and Personas**: Each page reflects the new data structure.

## Data Structure

The form collects and stores data in the following structure:
